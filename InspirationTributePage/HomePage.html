    <h2>Project Description</h2>
    <p>The goal of this project is to have a page to reference when you want to feel inspired. Welcome to the Passion Tribute Page coding lesson! In this assignment, you'll have the opportunity to create a tribute page dedicated to something or someone that inspires you deeply. The goal of this project is to not only develop your coding skills but also to express your passions and share them with others. Your tribute page will serve as a source of inspiration for both yourself and your peers. Your task is to design and code a tribute page that celebrates something or someone you're passionate about. This project will cover people who have influenced your life, a place you dream of visiting, an activity that brings you joy, and anything else that holds a special significance to you. Your tribute page should convey your admiration and appreciation for your chosen subject while showcasing your creativity and coding abilities.</p>
    <h3>People That Inspire Me</h3>
    <p> We will start our project with people that we are inspired by. "People" is very open-ended; this section can be people that we know personally, entertainers, or even fictional charcaters; shows, movies, video games, or a book material are all fair game. The goal is to let your imagination run wild. Take a moment to think about who you admire and why and then follow the directions below to begin developing!
    </p>

    <ol>
        <li> First, we will find an image of the charcater. Naviagte to google and find an image that you would like to use to highlight                the character that you or person that you admire. Right click on the image, and select <b>copy image address</b> and link it                into your project code.
        </li>
        <li> Next, we want to highlight the charcacters name. Replace the text that says "Character Name" in the first cell with the                    persons name that you're highlighting. </li>
        <li> Afterwards, we will write a short description of at least three sentences about why the character inspires us</li>
        <li> Lastly, we will link our readers to a page that highlights more information about this character so that they can read more                about them on their own.
        </li>
